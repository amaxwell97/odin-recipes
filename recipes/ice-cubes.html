            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>"I'm publishing this recipe because I'm sure that there are other families who have members, who don't know how or have forgotten how to make ice when the ice tray is empty."</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups water (approximately)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.</li>
                <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).</li>
                <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
                <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.</li>
                <li>Shut the door to the freezer.</li>
                <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.</li>
                <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.</li>

            <h1>Boiling Water</h1>
            <img src="images/boiling-water.jpg">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>"Boiling water is essential to many recipes. If you have never cooked before, don't worry. It is not as difficult as it may appear. This recipe will guide you through the process, even if you have never set foot in a kitchen."</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>water</li>
                <li>salt (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your cupboard or wherever it is you store your cookware.</li>
                <li>Locate a 12-quart stockpot. If you do not have a 12-quart stockpot, you may use whatever size pot you have; in that event, keep in mind that serving size here is 1 cup and there are 4 cups in a quart. Do the math.</li>
                <li>Place your pot in the sink under the tap. If you have never used a sink before, it is the large depression in your counter top. (If you live with someone else, they may have filled it with dirty dishes; in this case, wash them or simply remove them from the sink and place them in the oven — someone else will eventually discover them there and wash them.).</li>
                <li>Turn the cold-water knob to the "on" position. Some people (like my dad) prefer to let the water run a little bit. This is optional but encouraged — if it's a hot day or someone has previously used the "hot" water knob, the warmer water will eventually be replaced by truly cold water.</li>
                <li>Fill stockpot to within a couple inches of the rim.</li>
                <li>Lift stockpot from sink and transfer to stove. (Although appearances may vary, the stove is the thing with 4 or more circular metal bands on top of it; alternately, it may be a completely flat black glass surface. If you are unsure, ask your family, roommate, or neighbor for guidance.).</li>
                <li>Find knob on stove that corresponds to the "burner" you have placed your pot on. In addition to words like "Right Front" or "Left Rear," there are usually little pictures near the knobs to indicate position.</li>
                <li>Turn knob to "High" and wait until water boils. Depending on strength of your stove and amount of water, the boiling time may vary. Note: DO NOT WATCH THE POT; it will never boil in the event that you do.</li>
                <li>Boiled water may be used for any number of applications. Serve hot but do not drink.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Traditional PB&J</h1>
            <img src="images/pbj.jpg">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>"Nothing fancy, just a classic. Either smooth or crunch peanut butter is acceptable. Classically, the jelly is either strawberry or grape."</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 slices sandwich bread</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons grape jelly or 2 teaspoons strawberry jam</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread the peanut butter on one piece of bread.</li>
                <li>Spread the jelly on the other side.</li>
                <li>Put the two pieces of bread together to form a sandwich.</li>
                <li>Toddler adaptation: cut off crusts before serving.</li>
            </ol>
